                                Believing that a democratic country means showing your people what they are into and what data should they need to see, the government can make it possible for the citizens to scrutinize the accountability of the government. How it works, where the money
                                goes, and what the government does for the citizens. The first step of the president's act of transparency is by showing to the public the data that they are are entitled to see.

                                After the first move, the government can promote the democratization of data or the digging of data of the government to reveal the deeper information the citizens need. In this way, the citizens' view of the data will widen and will give them more fruitful
                                and significant information about their country and the government.

                                One of the epitome of practices at work in government is the act of such countries wherein they provide their citizens with tools that they can use to see or understand where, the taxes they pay, go. According to Texas Websites Improve Accountability
                                (TWIA), the state aims to improve government accounting, spending and transparency. One example of this practice is the state of Georgia helping its citizens better understand the spending of the tax dollars. Another one
                                is New Zealand which uses online tools to be transparent to its people and help them participate and gain knowledge about the things that matter to them.

                                Having a variety of benefits of the transparency, this may be the most important benefit the citizens can get from it. Because by seeing every little action that the government does, not even the smallest and vaguest act of cheating or stealing may not
                                be seen. The prices of oils, electricity and goods. The taxes they pay, where do they go and what good do they bring. The officials they elected, what do they do and what good do they give. All of these may show how the
                                country is progressing; into a corrupt or non-corrupt one. And it is important for the citizens to have not just a glimpse, but an actual view of what happens.
